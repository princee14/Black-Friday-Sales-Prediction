# Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction
This project predicts Black Friday customer purchase amounts using a Random Forest Regressor. It involves data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding variables), exploratory analysis (examining spending behavior), and feature engineering (creating a product interest feature). The model generates predictions with low RMSE.
