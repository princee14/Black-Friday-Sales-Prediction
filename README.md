# Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction
This project predicts customer purchase amounts during Black Friday sales using a Random Forest Regressor. It involves data preprocessing (handling missing values and encoding categorical variables), exploratory data analysis (analyzing spending behavior and feature correlations), and feature engineering (creating a new feature for product interest). The model is trained on a split dataset, achieving a low RMSE, and the final predictions are submitted in a CSV file. The project highlights skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning.
